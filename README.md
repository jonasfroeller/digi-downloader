# Digi-Downloader

A high-quality book downloader for digi4school.at that preserves vector graphics and generates compact PDF files.

## üéØ What it does

Downloads digital books from digi4school.at by:
1. Logging into the platform automatically
2. Finding and opening the specified book(s)
3. Extracting each page as SVG (vector graphics)
4. Inlining all assets (images) for offline viewing
5. Generating a combined PDF file

## ‚ú® Features

- **Vector-based output**: Maintains crisp, scalable graphics
- **Stealth browsing**: Anti-detection to avoid bot blocking
- **Multiple books**: Download single books, lists, or all available
- **Automatic pagination**: Handles multi-page books seamlessly
- **Compact files**: 45MB for 356 pages vs 1GB for rasterized images

## ü§î Why so complicated?

digi4school.at has bot detection that returns HTTP 450 errors during login if it detects automated behavior. This tool uses:
- `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` to mask automation signatures
- Persistent browser profiles to maintain session state
- Natural timing patterns to mimic human behavior
- Real Chrome browser instead of headless automation

Without these measures, the platform blocks automated access attempts.

## üìã Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) browser
- digi4school.at account
